 * blocks whose page-wide selectors bled into our chrome — the grey-box overlap
 * in MFG-151-13903 was an Outlook footer's stylesheet repositioning content.
 * On <script> it reasoned correctly: scripts genuinely do NOT execute when HTML
 * is assigned via innerHTML.
 *
 * But that is true of <script> ONLY. `<img src=x onerror=...>` fires the moment
 * it is inserted, in every browser, and the Shadow DOM below isolates CSS — not
 * script execution. So any of the hundreds of people who can email your service
 * desk could run code in an analyst's signed-in session. The shared cleaner now
 * strips every inline event handler and javascript:/data: URL as well.
 *
 * Fails CLOSED if safe-html.js is missing: markup is escaped to visible-but-inert

   COLLAPSING LONG MESSAGES  (discussion #104)

   A long email buries the thing you opened the ticket to read. Gmail's
   "···" is the shape everybody knows, so this is that.

   🔑 MEASURED, NOT COUNTED. The request asked for a line threshold; real
   inbound mail says lines are the wrong unit. A vendor notification laid
   out in a <table> is a handful of source lines and renders about a metre
   tall. So the trigger is the message's RENDERED height — the only number
   that matches what somebody has to scroll past. The SETTING is still
   phrased in lines because that is a sentence an administrator can reason
   about; includes/ticket_display.php does the conversion, once.

   ⚠️ NOTHING IS REMOVED. The whole message is in the page the whole time,
   behind a `max-height`. Boundary detection for quoted text is genuinely
   hard — the best-known solver quotes 98% on ordinary replies and names
   forwarded HTML as its weak spot — so being wrong here costs a tap, and
   can never cost a fact. That is the difference between this and stripping.

 * somebody sent us and exactly wrong for one we sent — so the moment a ticket
 * had an auto-reply or a workflow reply on it, which is the first thing that
 * happens to an emailed ticket, clicking Reply addressed the reply to
 * support@… . Because that mailbox is monitored, the reply came straight back
 * in as new inbound mail and the ticket talked to itself. Reported by Ed.

 *   Portal    from = them,  to = them   -> from
 *   Manual    from = them,  to = them   -> from
 *   Outbound  from = US,    to = them   -> to
 *
 * Only 'Outbound' is ours, so only it is special-cased; a direction added later
 * falls through to the long-standing behaviour rather than to a guess.

// ============================================
// Requester picker (discussion #54)
//
// One field replacing the old name + email pair. The email was already the
// identity — TicketsService looks the requester up by address — so the name box
// was doing nothing whenever the person existed, and a typo in the address
// silently created a second, ghost requester. Both of those are what this fixes.
//
// Shape, and why:
//   · Typeahead inline, NOT a modal. Raising a ticket on someone's behalf is a
//     tens-of-times-a-day action; a second surface to open and close is friction
//     paid every time to help a rare case. The modal still exists, behind the
//     magnifier, for when you want to browse rather than search.
//   · "+ Add someone new" is ALWAYS the last row, not a zero-results state. If
//     you are adding a Dan and a Dan already exists, a no-matches trigger would
//     never appear — the one time you most need it.
//   · Choosing sends user_id. The server re-checks it with analystCanAccessUser:
//     the list being scoped governs what is easy to pick, not what can be sent.

// ===========================================================================
//
// "I can't do anything with this until Thursday." Snoozing takes the ticket out
// of every folder and puts it in Snoozed until its time comes, so the morning
// queue is work rather than a list of things to re-decide you can't touch.
//
// The wake time is computed SERVER-SIDE from a preset key — the labels here are
// only labels. That keeps one definition of what "tomorrow morning" means (the
// analyst's zone, the install's wake hour) instead of two that drift, and means
// a stale page can't snooze a ticket to yesterday.
//
// Waking is the clock: a ticket is asleep while snoozed_until is in the future
// and awake the moment it isn't. Nothing has to run for it to come back.

// The presets, in the order they appear. `key` is what the server understands;
// `at` computes the same instant locally so the row can show what it means.
//
// `available` drops a preset whose name would stop being true. "This evening"
// after 18:00 can only mean tomorrow evening, and a row reading "This evening —
// Tomorrow 18:00" is a menu arguing with itself. Gmail hides its presets the
// same way, and "In 3 hours" already covers the rest of the night.

/* ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Row display chips (discussion #61)
 *
 * What appears on each ticket row is per-analyst, resolved server-side and handed
 * to us as INBOX_ROW_DISPLAY — see includes/inbox_display.php. Every value has
 * already been validated against the registry there, but these functions still
 * whitelist before building a class name, because a renderer that trusts its
 * input is one stored value away from markup injection.
 *
 * ⚠️ Three placements, and the reason there are three:
 *   stripe → a bar on the LEFT EDGE. Costs no horizontal space, reads instantly
 *            down a queue, and cannot be confused with the SLA dot.
 *   block  → a small square top-RIGHT. Quiet; deliberately not top-left, where it
 *            would fight the unread marker.
 *   pill/dot → in the footer row beside the date, next to the SLA pill. The
 *            noisiest, and the only one that carries the actual word.
 *
 * The SLA indicator in that footer is ALREADY a red/amber/green dot. A priority
 * dot is therefore available but not the default: two traffic lights in one row,
 * meaning different things, is worse than one.

   THE AI READING AIDS  (discussion #104, ideas 7 and 12)

   Two separate things that happen to share a provider:

     • THE MAINTAINED SUMMARY — a standing few lines at the top of the ticket
       saying where it stands. Stored, versioned, and refreshed when the
       conversation has moved on.
     • READ THIS TICKET FOR ME — a briefing you ask for and read once. Stored
       nowhere.

   ⚠️ Both are OFF unless an administrator turned them on. window.TICKET_AI is
   emitted by the page rather than fetched, so on an install that wants none of
   this the buttons are never even built — there is nothing to click, nothing to
   fail, and nothing to explain.

   🔑 THE SUMMARY NEVER STANDS IN FOR THE TICKET. It carries the time it was
   written, what it read, and — the part that matters — how far the conversation
   has moved since. A summary that quietly describes a ticket as it was four
   messages ago is worse than no summary, because it reads exactly like one that
   is current.
