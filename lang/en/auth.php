/**
 * English (en) — Analyst sign-in page strings (auth/login.php).
 *
 * The analyst sign-in page was the last screen in the product still written in
 * hardcoded English. The self-service portal's own sign-in page has been
 * translated since it was built, which meant the requester-facing door was
 * localised and the staff-facing front door was not.
 *
 * ⚠️ This page must never fail. It is the one screen where a PHP error locks
 * every analyst out of the product, so auth/login.php loads i18n behind a guard
 * and falls back to English if anything here cannot be read.
