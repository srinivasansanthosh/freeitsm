/**
 * Workflow Engine
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Cross-module automation. Other modules CALL into this engine when their
 * events happen (e.g. tickets/save.php calls WorkflowEngine::dispatch(
 * 'ticket.created', ['ticket' => $row]) after a successful insert). The
 * engine finds active workflows matching the event, evaluates conditions
 * against the payload, executes actions in order, and writes a row to
 * workflow_executions for every run so the user can see what happened.
 *
 * The contract is deliberately small in v1:
 *
 *   - Triggers are flat event-name strings. The catalogue lives in
 *     availableTriggers(); new ones are added here and wired in their
 *     module's save flow.
 *
 *   - Conditions are an array of {field, op, value} objects. The engine
 *     reads `field` from the payload via dot-notation (`ticket.priority`).
 *     All conditions must match (AND). If empty, the workflow always fires.
 *
 *   - Actions are an array of {type, args} objects executed in order.
 *     The catalogue lives in availableActions(); the handlers live as
 *     private methods on this class so each action's contract is in one
 *     place.
 *
 *   - Execution is synchronous in v1. Each event triggers a same-request
 *     pass through the engine. An async queue + retries are planned but
 *     not built — keep actions fast and idempotent.
 *
 * Failures don't propagate. The engine catches per-step exceptions, logs
 * them in the execution row, and continues. The point is that a buggy
 * workflow can't take down the host module's request.

    //      A workflow already on the stack is refused re-entry. This alone
    //      catches every cycle: a cycle must revisit a node still on the
    //      stack.
    //   2. MAX_CHAIN_DEPTH — a hard ceiling on nesting depth. Backstop for an
    //      absurdly deep but acyclic cascade (A -> B -> C -> ... all distinct).
    //   3. MAX_RUNS_PER_REQUEST — a ceiling on total runs in one request.
    //      Backstop for fan-out blow-ups where each run spawns new, distinct
    //      workflows without ever cycling.
    //
    // A blocked run is still recorded as an 'aborted' execution row so the
    // user can see the engine stepped in (see recordAbortedRun()).
